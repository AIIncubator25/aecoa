  flexible_requirements: |
    The HS requirements may vary based on the project scenario:
    - Standard residential projects typically use the residential_standard configuration
    - HDB flats may have different GFA categories and thinner slabs
    - Commercial mixed-use buildings may have higher clearance requirements
    - International projects may use different measurement conventions
    
    Always adapt your analysis to the specific project requirements provided.
