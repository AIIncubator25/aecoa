Analyze the provided technical drawings against the specified requirements using your intelligence and contextual understanding.

REQUIREMENTS TO CHECK:
{param_context}

DRAWINGS PROVIDED:
{drawing_list}

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- Prioritise extracting tabular data from the drawings first. Use tables, schedules, and structured notes as the main source of truth.
- When encountering a slanted HS slab (inclined or tapered), interpret its thickness as the "waist thickness" requirement under Clause 2.10(c).
- If multiple sources show different values, use the most detailed table value; otherwise, cross-check dimensions and annotate.
- Ensure every requirement row has a corresponding attempted "Identified Value".
 - Table-specific guidance (critical for HS):
    Locate the HS data table and read exact values (no guessing). Table titles may vary, e.g.: "DATA OF HOUSEHOLD SHELTER", "HOUSEHOLD SHELTER DATA", "HS SCHEDULE", "HS DATA", "HOUSEHOLD SHELTER SCHEDULE".
    Map the table columns to these fields using semantic matching (accept common variants/abbreviations):
       • Unit_Area (Unit GFA): "GFA of Unit (m2)", "GFA", "Unit GFA", "Unit Area", "Area of Unit"
       • HS_Area: "AREA of HS (m2)", "HS Area", "HS AREA"
       • HS_Volume: "VOLUMN of HS (m3)", "VOLUME of HS", "HS Volume"
       • HS_Slab_Thickness: "HS Ceiling Slab Thickness (m)", "Ceiling Slab Thickness", "HS Slab Thickness"
   • HS_Waist_Thickness: if not present in the HS table, extract from Sectional Elevations/Sections (e.g., "Sectional Elevation Y1/Y2", "Section A-A/B-B"). Look for callouts like "waist", "staircase waist", "slanted slab", "inclined slab", or thickness arrows near the HS. Record the thickness value.
       • Optional: "HS Wall Thickness (m)", "HS Clear Height (m)", "Unit Storey Height (m)"
    Normalize units:
       • Report thicknesses in mm (convert from m if needed)
       • Keep areas in m2 and volumes in m3
    Output requirements:
       • Return a fenced CSV block (```csv ... ```)
       • Header: No,Clause,Parameter,Min. Irregular HS Countable Area,Unit,Min. Volume (m3),Unit GFA,HS Area,HS Volume,HS Slab Thickness,HS underneath Staircase Waist Thickness,Compliance (Y/N),Reference Drawing
       • Populate Unit_Area from the unit GFA value; leave cells blank if not present; use numeric values only

DXF TEXT CONTENT (if available):

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Prioritise the tables** in the drawings. Extract values row by row, matching them to the parameters in the requirement table.
2. **Understand the requirements** - Interpret each parameter (HS Floor Area, Volume, Height Clearance, Slab Thickness, Waist Thickness, Unobstructed Distance).
3. **Identify values systematically**:
   - Use drawing schedules and tables as primary input.
   - If the HS table lacks slab or waist thickness, scan Sectional Elevations/Sections (Y1, Y2, A-A, B-B) for dimensions (e.g. 300mm) callouts, especially near the HS ceiling/floor, and use those values.
   - Map "slanted slab thickness" explicitly as the waist thickness value.
4. **Compare against requirements** - Determine compliance with reasoning.
5. **Always complete the CSV table row by row**, even if some values are "Not Found".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate your analysis as a properly formatted CSV table with these exact columns (match header exactly):

No,Clause,Parameter,Min. Irregular HS Countable Area,Unit,Min. Volume (m3),Unit GFA,HS Area,HS Volume,HS Slab Thickness,HS underneath Staircase Waist Thickness,Compliance (Y/N),Reference Drawing
