Refactoring Guide for agent2_drawing_analyzer.py
"""

# BEFORE REFACTORING: Single 900+ line file
# - DrawingAnalysisAgent class with ~30 methods
# - Mixed responsibilities: config, file handling, API calls, data processing
# - Hard to maintain, test, and extend

# AFTER REFACTORING: Modular architecture with 5 focused components

"""
1. COMPLIANCE_CONFIG.PY (~112 lines)
   - Manages compliance templates and HS scenarios
   - Domain-specific patterns and configurations
   - Separated from main logic for easier configuration management
"""

"""
2. FILE_HANDLER.PY (~130 lines) 
   - DXF text extraction using ezdxf
   - File upload/save operations
   - All file I/O operations in one place
   - Easy to mock for testing
"""

"""
3. DATA_PROCESSOR.PY (~150 lines)
   - DataFrame operations and standardization
   - CSV/JSON parsing and cleaning
   - Column mapping and fuzzy matching
   - Data transformation logic isolated
"""

"""
4. API_CLIENT.PY (~120 lines)
   - OpenAI/GovTech API communication
   - Image encoding and API call management  
   - Error handling for network operations
   - Easy to swap providers or add new ones
"""

"""
5. DRAWING_ANALYSIS_AGENT.PY (~200 lines)
   - Main orchestrator that coordinates all components
   - Public API remains the same for backward compatibility
   - Much cleaner and focused on orchestration
   - Each component handles its specific domain
"""

# BENEFITS OF REFACTORED ARCHITECTURE:

"""
✅ SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
   - Each class has one clear responsibility
   - Easier to understand and modify individual components

✅ BETTER TESTABILITY  
   - Components can be tested in isolation
   - Mock dependencies easily for unit tests
   - Faster test execution

✅ IMPROVED MAINTAINABILITY
   - Changes to file handling don't affect API logic
   - Configuration changes isolated from processing logic
   - Bugs easier to locate and fix

✅ ENHANCED EXTENSIBILITY
   - Easy to add new AI providers (just extend APIClient)
   - New compliance domains (just update ComplianceConfigManager)
   - New file formats (just extend FileHandler)

✅ REDUCED CODE DUPLICATION
   - Common patterns extracted into reusable methods
   - Consistent error handling across components
   - Shared utilities in appropriate modules

✅ BETTER CODE ORGANIZATION
   - Related functionality grouped together
   - Clear import structure
   - Logical file naming conventions
"""

# IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

"""
STEP 1: Extract Configuration Logic
   - Move compliance templates to compliance_config.py
   - Move HS scenarios loading to same module
   - Create ComplianceConfigManager class

STEP 2: Extract File Operations  
   - Move DXF extraction to file_handler.py
   - Move file upload/save logic to same module
   - Create DrawingFileHandler class

STEP 3: Extract Data Processing
   - Move DataFrame operations to data_processor.py  
   - Move JSON/CSV parsing logic to same module
   - Create DataProcessor class

STEP 4: Extract API Communication
   - Move OpenAI/GovTech calls to api_client.py
   - Move image encoding logic to same module
   - Create APIClient class

STEP 5: Refactor Main Agent
   - Keep only orchestration logic in main agent
   - Inject dependencies in constructor  
   - Delegate to appropriate components
   - Maintain backward compatibility
"""

# BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:

"""
The refactored DrawingAnalysisAgent maintains the same public API:
- analyze_drawings()
- process_drawing_files() 
- set_compliance_domain()
- set_hs_scenario()
- get_file_summary()

Existing code using the agent will continue to work without changes.
"""

# TESTING STRATEGY:

"""
UNIT TESTS for each component:
- test_compliance_config.py
- test_file_handler.py  
- test_data_processor.py
- test_api_client.py

INTEGRATION TESTS:
- test_drawing_analysis_agent.py (end-to-end)

MOCK STRATEGY:
- Mock API calls in tests
- Mock file I/O operations
- Use dependency injection for testing
"""

# PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

"""
✅ FASTER IMPORTS
   - Only import what's needed in each module
   - Lazy loading of heavy dependencies (ezdxf)

✅ MEMORY EFFICIENCY
   - Components can be garbage collected independently
   - No need to keep entire agent in memory for simple operations

✅ PARALLEL PROCESSING POTENTIAL
   - File operations can be parallelized
   - Multiple API calls can be batched
   - Processing pipeline can be optimized

✅ CACHING OPPORTUNITIES
   - Configuration can be cached
   - DXF text extraction results can be cached
   - API responses can be cached
